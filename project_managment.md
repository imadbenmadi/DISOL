### **1. Define Core Features & Data Model First**  
- Before coding anything, define the main **features** of the platform (e.g., Home Page, User Profile, Dashboard, etc.).  
- Build a **high-level architecture** (what data is needed, what APIs are required, and how they interact).  
- Sketch out **database models** (this helps prevent constant API changes later).

### **2. Design First, Then Develop**  
- Get UI/UX designs ready first (even if just wireframes).  
- Set up a **design system** (Tailwind or component-based UI like Shadcn for consistency).  
- This way, the front-end team won’t waste time redoing stuff.

### **3. API First Approach (Mocking APIs Early)**  
- **Set up a Swagger/OpenAPI doc** or just agree on API contracts in Postman.  
- Use **mock data** (JSON Server, Mockoon, or just static JSON files in the front end) so front-end devs don’t wait for backend devs.  
- Backend devs can then develop APIs without being rushed.

### **4. Parallel Development with Clear Milestones**  
Instead of doing **one feature at a time across full stack**, do it **by layers**:

✅ **Week 1-2: Core Setup**  
   - Set up monorepo (Turbo, NX) or separate repos  
   - DB schema ready, API contract finalized  
   - Basic Next.js app structure, reusable UI components  

✅ **Week 3-4: Backend Core APIs & Auth**  
   - User Authentication (JWT/OAuth)  
   - Role-based Access (Admin, User)  
   - Dashboard structure ready  

✅ **Week 5+: Feature-Specific Development** (Iterative)  
   - Feature 1 (e.g., Home Page): API + UI integration done **together**  
   - Feature 2 (User Profile)  
   - Feature 3 (Dashboard functionalities)  

### **5. Automate and Optimize Deployment**  
- Use **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions, Vercel for frontend, cPanel VPS for backend)  
- **Database migrations** automated (Prisma, Sequelize, etc.)  
- **Error logging early** (Sentry, LogRocket)

This way, you **don’t get stuck waiting**, and every phase is structured. Try it out and tweak it for DISOL’s needs.
