Since Disol is already being built as a website & content management platform, integrating automation as a service is a next-level move. Here’s a full path on how to make this happen:


---

🚀 Phase 1: Core Setup (Disol as a Platform)

1️⃣ Define the Core Offerings in Disol

Disol is already focused on:
✅ Website Building – No-code/low-code website creation
✅ Content Management – Blog posting, SEO, scheduling

Now, we add:
✅ Automation Services – To help businesses automate their workflows

2️⃣ Choose the Right Automation Stack

To offer automation, we need to integrate the right tools. Some options:

Make (ex-Integromat) – No-code automation

Zapier – For simple automation workflows

n8n (Open-source) – For advanced automation

Custom API integrations – For deeper control
