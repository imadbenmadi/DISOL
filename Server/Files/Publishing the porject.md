### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Work on the Project Properly**

-   Use **Jupyter Notebook** to write the code & explanations.
-   Push your project to **GitHub** (with a README file explaining the project).
-   If you want visuals, use **Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **Tableau** for an interactive dashboard.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Share It on LinkedIn**

-   Post a short **write-up** about your project.
-   Include key insights (e.g., "Smokers pay **3x more** in insurance! üö¨üî•").
-   Attach **screenshots** (graphs, Tableau visualizations, Jupyter Notebook).
-   Drop the **GitHub link** so people can check your full work.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus** (To Stand Out More)

-   If you want a **portfolio website**, use **Vercel** (with Next.js).
-   Record a **short video** walking through the project (optional).

**Tableau?** ‚úÖ If you want to impress non-technical people, use it for interactive dashboards. Otherwise, **Matplotlib/Seaborn** is enough.
